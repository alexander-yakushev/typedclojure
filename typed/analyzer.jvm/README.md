## Differences from tools.analyzer.jvm

core.typed.analyzer.jvm is a heavily modified variant of tools.analyzer.jvm.
If you're familiar with the latter, here's what this library does differently.

- Adds an `:unanalyzed` AST node that just holds a `:form` and `:env`.
- Forms are analyzed lazily, with `:unanalyzed` nodes being used for immediate children.
- `:unanalyzed` nodes support a `:clojure.core.typed.analyzer/config` entry which will be associated
  onto whatever node it becomes when analyzed.
- `clojure.tools.analyzer.env` is not used.
- `resolve-{sym,ns}` are now dynamic variables that are implemented for each platform.
- `run-passes` only supports a single pass
- `uniquify-locals` is a default pass that is compatible with `:unanalyzed` nodes
- Gilardi scenario can be (carefully) managed (see `clojure.core.typed.analyzer.jvm.gilardi-test` for a type system example)
