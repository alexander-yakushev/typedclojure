- introduce `t/Instance` and `t/Satisfies`
  - `t/Instance` provides classes with invariant type parameters with a common super type
    - e.g., `(t/Instance Comparable)` is a supertype of `(Comparable Any)`
  - similar for `t/Satisfies`, but for protocols
  - helpful for the return filters of `instance?` and `satisfies?`
    - i.e., we learn `(t/Instance Comparable)` if `(instance? Comparable ..)`, not `(Comparable Any)`
- add Class <: Protocol, DataType <: Protocol cases to constraint generation
- fix Class <: Protocol subtyping case
- assert that annotation is required when extending invariant protocols with deftype
- fix intersection simplication after change in 1.1.5
  - `(I Int (Nilable Int)) => Int`, not `(Nilable Int)`
- resolve first argument to `override-class` at runtime
- improve Java 21 support
  - annotate `java.util.SequencedCollection` and extend in `java.util.List`
