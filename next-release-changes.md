- improve `clojure.core/reductions` annotation
  - 2-arity must support zero-args on 1 arg
    - except when input collection is non-empty
  - add support for `reduced` values
  - return seq is always non-empty
- fix `clojure.core/reduce` annotation
  - result of calling first arg with zero-args does not unwrap `reduced`
  - use one type variable in 2-arity
