- lib.core.async improvements
  - register annotations/extensions without loading core.async
  - don't load `typed.clojure`  in macros namespace
- add support for `(requiring-resolve 'fully-qualified/sym)`
  - assumes that `fully-qualified` is not an alias in any namespace
  - at type checking time, if `(requiring-resolve 'fully-qualified/sym)` evaluates
    to a var, and a type annotation is found for `fully-qualified/sym`, then
    returns type `(t/Var (t/TypeOf fully-qualified/sym))`
- improve `requiring-resolve` annotation
  - never returns a Class
- annotate `clojure.core/record?`
- support `__meta` and `__extmap` on records
- Breaking: remove `:no-eval` option on `check-form` family of functions
  - replaced by `:check-config {:check-form-eval :{before/never}}`
- Add new options to control evaluation of forms
  - the following keys can be passed in the `:check-config` map accepted by `check-{ns,form}`
    - check-ns will forward them to check-form
  - :check-ns-load
    - If :require-before-check, `require` all checked namespaces before checking.
    - If :never, don't load files before checking.
    - Default: :never
  - :check-form-eval
    - Configures when to evaluate a form relative to type checking it.
    - If :never, don't evaluate individual forms as part of type checking. Avoids side effects during expansion and analysis.
    - If :before, evaluate entire individual forms before type checking, ignoring the Gilardi scenario. Avoids side effects during expansion and analysis.
    - If :after, evaluate individual forms after type checking, respecting the Gilardi scenario.
    - Default: :after
- add new configuration for analyzer
  - `typed.clj.analyzer/*parse-deftype-with-existing-class*`
    - If true, don't generate a new class when analyzing deftype* if a class of the same name already exists.
- Support keywords passed as functions to polymorphic higher-order functions
  - now `(map :a ...)` checks like `(map #(:a %) ...)`
    - both participate in symbolic inference
