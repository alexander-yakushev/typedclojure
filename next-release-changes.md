- require expected type for `defmulti`
- enable symbolic closures by default
  - checking is deferred for unannotated local functions until (and only if) they are applied
- more precise annotation for `clojure.core.async/pipe`
- deprecated old annotation macros `clojure.core.typed/{for,dotimes,doseq}`
  - obsoleted by the improved type inference of the new macro rules for `clojure.core/{for,dotimes,doseq}`
